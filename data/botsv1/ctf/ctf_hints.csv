5,"Start your search with ""sourcetype=stream:http"" and review the rich data captured in these events. ",1,101
10,"You'll notice that source and destination IP addresses are stored in fields called src_ip and dest_ip respectively. Determine top-talkers for HTTP by combining : ""sourcetype=stream:http | stats count by src_ip, dest_ip | sort -count""",2,101
20,Many commercial web vulnerability scanners clearly identify themselves in the headers of the HTTP request. Inspect the HTTP source headers (src_headers) of requests from the IP identified in question 101.,1,102
15,Look for successful (http status code of 200) GET requests from the scanning IP address (identified previously) and inspect the fields related to URL/URI for clues to the CMS in use.,1,103
10,First find the IP address of the web server hosting imreallynotbatman.com. You may have found this IP during the course of answering the previous few questions.,1,104
25,"Revealing sourcetypes include stream:http, fgt_utm, and suricata. ",2,104
25,"The key here is searching for events where the IP address of the web server is the source. Because it's a web server, we most often see it as a destination but in this case the intruder took control of the server and pulled the defacement file from an internet site. ",3,104
25,"Consider the answer to question 104. The fully qualified domain name was recorded by Stream, Suricata, and the Fortigate firewall.",1,105
15,"Consider the answer to question 104. The IP address was recorded by Stream, Suricata, and the Fortigate firewall. Do you dig me?",1,106
15,"Malicious IP addresses, like the one in the last question are examples of attacker infrastructure. Infrastructure is often reused by the same group. Use a service like www.robtex.com to determine other domains that are or have been associated with this attacker infrastructure (IP address).",1,107
20,Use the whois lookup on domaintools.com to iterate through domains associated with this IP and visually search for suspicious email addresses. Your knowledge of Batman will help you here!,2,107

5,File uploads to web forms use the HTTP POST method. ,1,109
20,The question mentions and executable. Search for common executable filename extensions on Windows systems.,2,109
25,"It will be difficult to calulate a hash based on the Splunk event you used to answer 109. Instead Search for the file name in a different data source to find evidence of execution, including file hash values.",1,110
25,This is an ideal use case for Microsoft Sysmon data. Determine the sourcetype for Sysmon events and search them for the executable.,2,110
20,You need to pivot outside of Splunk to answer this question. Use the IP address discovered earlier to search for malware that has been associated with it in the past.,1,111
25,"Experienced analysts know to use sites like www.threatminer.org to search for malware associated with the malicious IP address, but if all alse fails, Google it!",2,111
50,Do some further research on the hash discovered in the last question. Virustotal.com is a good starting place.,1,112
75,malwr.com might lead you astray,2,112
100,"The hex codes we are after here will be formatted like this: 49 66 20 79 6f 75 20 64 65 63 6f 64 65 20 74 68 65 20 68 69 6e 74 2c 20 79 6f 75 20 64 6f 6e 27 74 20 6e 65 65 64 20 61 20 68 69 6e 74 21. Submit the hex codes, but decode them on the web for fun!",3,112
25,Use a service like www.robtex.com to determine other domains that are or have been associated with the attacker infrastructure (IP address).,1,113
50,Use a high quality whois site like www.domaintools.com to perform whois lookups against these domains until you see a hex code where you were expecting text. Warning not all whois sites show you all fields!,2,113
25,"Login attempts will use the HTTP POST method, and they will include some obvious fields that you can search for in the form_data field of stream:http events.",1,114
50,"By default, Splunk will put the most recent events at the top of the list. You can use the ""reverse"" SPL command to show you least recent first.",2,114
10,"If you have not done so already, try to extract the attempted password into a new field using the ""rex"" SPL command and a regular expression. Having the password attempt in its own field will serve you well for the next several questions!",1,115
20,"It's not hard to get a list of songs by the artist. Once you have that,use the ""len()"" function of the ""eval"" SPL command. For Splunk style points, use a lookup table to match the password attempts with songs.",2,115
100,"From the previous questions, you should know how to extract the password attempts.  You should also know what IP is submitting passwords.  Are any other IP addresses submitting passwords?",1,116
50,"Calculate the length of every password attempt and store the result in a new field. Then calulate the average of that new field with a stats command. Use eval to average, or just visually inspect.",1,117
50,"Then calulate the average of that new length field with a stats command, and finally use eval to round, or just manually round.",2,117
100,You'll note from previous answers that one of the passwords was attempted twice. You need to calculate the duration of time between those two attempts.,1,118
50,"Need more help? Write a search that returns only the two events in questions, then use  either ""| delta _time"" or ""| transaction <extracted-pword-attempt>"" SPL commands.",2,118
100,"Be sure you are extracting the password attempts correctly, then use a stats function to count unique (not total) attempts.",1,119
15,Keep it simple and just search for the hostname provided in the question.  Try using the stats command to get a count of events by source ip address to point you in the right direction.,1,200
15,Keep it simple and start your search by looking at only the sourcetype associated with Suricata and maybe even the name of the malware in question.  The field containing the signature ID should be obvious.  Use stats to create a count by the field containing the signature ID.  ,1,201
50,Search stream:dns data for A queries coming from the infected workstation IP on the date in question.  Try and narrow your search period.,1,202
100,"Perform a shannon entropy analysis on the query{} field using URL toolbox by adding this to the end of the search: |`ut_shannon(query{})` | stats count by ut_shannon, query{} | sort -ut_shannon ",2,202

80,Go and git some IOCs on Cerber.  Then compare to the DNS Data,4,203
150,"Keep it simple.  Start by looking at sysmon data for the infected device on the date in question.  Calculate the length of the command line using the ""len()"" function of the ""eval"" SPL command, and give your eyes a break by using the splunk table command. ",1,204
100,Tough question.  Perhaps you should give http://answers.splunk.com a try.,1,205
25,"Search for SMB (Windows file sharing protocol) traffic from the infected device on the date in question. The ""stats"" SPL command can be used to count the most common destination IP for the SMB protocol.",1,206
10,Don't use SMB this time - it's a trap!  Windows event logs are the way to go for this one.  Focus on the event types that deal with windows shares and narrow the search by looking for distinct filenames for the extension in question. ,1,207
25,"Embrace your sysmon data.  Search for a command issued by the infected device on the date in question referencing the filename in question, and use the process_id, ParentProcessId, CommandLine,  and ParentCommandLine, to track down the parent process id of them all.",1,208
15,Sysmon to the rescue again.  Focus on the infected machine as well as the user profile while searching for the filename extension in question.,1,209
50,"In Sysmon events, EventCode=2 indicates file creation time has changed. Watch out for duplicates!",2,209
75,"When looking for potentially malicious file, start your search with the Suricata data.  Narrow your search by focusing on the infected device. Remember malware does not always have to begin as an executable file.  ",1,210
